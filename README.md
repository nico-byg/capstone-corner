## üåü Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have significantly developed both my technical skills and professional mindset. This ePortfolio represents the culmination of that growth, providing evidence of my capabilities across software development, data management, cybersecurity, and collaborative practices.

Creating and enhancing the artifacts in this portfolio helped me translate academic knowledge into practical applications. Each project required me to engage with industry-relevant tools, respond to feedback, and work iteratively‚Äîskills that are critical in a modern software development environment. Beyond coding, I learned to think critically, plan strategically, and communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

This program has shaped my professional goals: I aim to work in backend or systems development roles where I can build efficient, secure, and maintainable software. I value continuous learning and integrity, and my approach reflects a balance between technical excellence and responsible engineering.

### üîπ Key Competencies Demonstrated

- **Team Collaboration:** Across courses, I worked on team-based projects where we had to plan, divide tasks, and integrate our work. This experience taught me the importance of documentation, version control (using Git), and respectful communication.
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Several assignments required translating technical choices into plain-language justifications, improving my ability to communicate project goals, limitations, and outcomes.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** I have applied algorithmic reasoning in Python, Java, and C++ to solve problems involving sorting, searching, graph traversal, and time-space tradeoffs.
- **Software Engineering & Databases:** From designing relational schemas to integrating APIs in full-stack applications, I learned how to manage software complexity and ensure scalable, maintainable systems.
- **Security Considerations:** Security was embedded in several artifacts. I applied principles like least privilege, secure data handling, and proper authentication, especially in projects involving database operations and user input.

### üîπ About This ePortfolio

This portfolio showcases enhanced versions of major projects from the Computer Science program. Each artifact demonstrates a distinct area of my technical ability, from data migration tooling to web-based interfaces. Together, they highlight my breadth as a computer scientist and my readiness for real-world challenges in the tech industry.

## üìÅ Artifact 1: Porter ‚Äì A CSV-to-MongoDB Migration Utility

**Artifact Type:** Python CLI tool  
**Created:** Capstone Project (2025)

### üîπ Description
Porter is a command-line utility designed for system administrators to port data from CSV files into MongoDB databases with control and flexibility. The tool includes modular support for header detection, data normalization, MongoDB integration, and logging.

### üîπ Justification
This artifact demonstrates my skills in backend scripting, database interaction, modular design, and error handling. I included this project because it shows how I can develop real-world, automatable tools that align with DevOps and data engineering workflows. Enhancements included implementing structured logging, config file management, and safe retry mechanisms. These improvements demonstrate proficiency with file I/O, defensive coding, and integration with external libraries like `pymongo` and `logging`.

### üîπ Reflection
Enhancing Porter helped me realize the complexity of system-level tools that seem simple at first glance. I faced challenges with schema normalization and needed to handle diverse CSV encodings and malformed rows. I learned how to sanitize inputs, gracefully log failures, and keep the system robust even in unpredictable environments. I incorporated feedback that emphasized more flexible configuration and better error visibility. This artifact demonstrates mastery in software engineering, database operations, and secure development practices, meeting all relevant course outcomes.
